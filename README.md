# DBZ WMW


## Overview

This is the official repository for the Dragon Ball Z Wintermaul Wars (DBZ WMW) custom game for Warcraft III.  

This game was branched from a different version of Wintermaul Wars in 2005, and has been extensively edited, balanced, and playtested on and off since then.

This is a classic "Tower Wars" style game, where each team of up to 3 players must build a maze of towers to defeat the creeps sent by the opposing team before a threshold number reach the team's home base.  The tower races, creeps, upgrades etc. are all based on the Dragon Ball anime franchise.

Versions 3.9 and prior were developed for Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.  Edits from version 3.9b onwards are catered towards Warcraft III: Reforged.

To play this game through Warcraft III, simply copy it into your `Maps` directory.  At least 2 human players are needed (1 on each team).  Player 2 (Blue) controls the game time.  As such, this should usually be the slot that the host takes.

Please feel free to raise an Issue should you find any bugs.




## Disclaimer

While I  -- former gaming alias "Blushot69" (embarrasingly), now operating under Battle.net Tag Behemoth#11870 -- have led all the development of this game since DBZ WMW's inception, the game still relies on certain triggers and custom scripts developed in earlier versions of WMW that I did not contribute towards.  I also have not developed any of the custom models introduced after v3.8, at least not beyond minor adjustments to skins.  These have been pooled from various online resources and other Warcraft III custom games.   My sincere thanks go to modding community for producing these assets.

Version 3.9b onwards appears to be stable on Reforged, although much is yet to be done to optimise for the new graphical and interface defaults.
